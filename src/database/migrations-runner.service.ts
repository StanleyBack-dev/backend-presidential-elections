 * Runs pending migrations on boot, before the app serves requests.
 *
 * TypeORM's own `migrationsRun` takes no lock, so on Vercel several cold
 * starts after a deploy could run the same migration at once. Here all
 * pending migrations run in ONE transaction that first takes
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock`: concurrent instances queue on the lock, and by
 * the time they get it the migrations table already lists everything.
 * The transaction-scoped lock (not the session one) is deliberate — it is
 * reliable through Neon's pooled (PgBouncer, transaction-mode) endpoint.
